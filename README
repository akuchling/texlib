tex_wrap v1.00
==============

This is an implementation of the dynamic programming algorithm,
originally developed by D.E. Knuth and M.F. Plass, used by TeX to
break a paragraph into lines.  I won't describe the algorithm in
detail here; for a full explanation, see the chapter describing it in
Knuth's book _Digital Typography_, which explains the theory and shows
how to use it to achieve various clever effects.

The interface is fairly simple.  Create an ObjectList instance and
fill it with a series of Box, Glue, and Penalty objects representing a
single paragraph.  When you've done that, call the ObjectList's
.add_closing_penalty() method to add the standard glue and penalty for
a paragraph end.  Then call its .compute_breakpoints() method which
does all the work and returns a list of integers, which are the
indexes at which the text should be broken.

The signature of this method is:
    def compute_breakpoints(self,
                            line_lengths,
                            looseness = 0,  
                            tolerance = 1,
                            fitness_demerit = 100, 
                            flagged_demerit = 100, 
                            ):

line_lengths is the only required parameter, and is a list of integers
giving the lengths of each line.  The last element of the list is
reused for subsequent lines.  So you can pass [100] for a paragraph
that's 100 units wide, or range(140, 20, -10) for a triangular
paragraph.  There's no particular unit for width, so you can work in
points or pixels or whatever you like.

The rest of the parameters are optional.  looseness is an integer
value. If it's positive, the paragraph will be set to take that many
lines more than the optimum value, so you can make a paragraph take up
an extra line.  If it's negative, the paragraph is set that many lines
tighter, if possible; usually you'll only manage to set it a single
line tighter.  qlooseness defaults to zero, meaning the optimal length
for the paragraph.

tolerance is the maximum adjustment ratio allowed for a line.  It
defaults to 1, meaning that all the glue on the line is stretched up
to its specified stretch value.

fitness_demerit is additional value added to the demerit score when
two consecutive lines are in different fitness classes.  There are
four classes: very tight, tight, loose, and very loose.  The algorithm
tries to avoid having a very tight line next to a very loose line,
because the difference is visible and distracting.

flagged_demerit is an additional value added to the demerit score when
breaking at the second of two flagged qpenalties.

Once you've got the list of optimal breakpoints, formatting and
outputting the text is up to you; I haven't implemented an API for
this because I have no idea what such an API would look like.  Box
instances have a 'character' attribute that you can specify, so you
can set this to the character for a given box for later use by an
output pass.  (It needn't be a character; you could set it to an
arbitrary object if you like, though then the name is rather
misleading.)

Bug reports, sample code, and notes about the module's usage are
